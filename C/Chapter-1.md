# Chapter 1: Variables

## Definition

A variable is a named memory location used to store data temporarily during the execution of a program.

### Rules

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Variables are case sensitive. For example, `char a = 'a'` and `char A = 'A'` are treated as different variables.

2. **Naming Convention**: 
   - The first character of a variable name must be an alphabet letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (`_`).
   - Subsequent characters can include digits (0-9) and underscores (`_`).
   - Spaces and special characters (like `$`, `!`, etc.) are not allowed in variable names.

3. **Example**: Incorrect usage like `int final price = 100` (with a space) will result in an error. Instead, use `int finalPrice = 100` or `int final_price = 100`.

### Brief Explanation

Variables in programming serve as placeholders for data that can be manipulated and used within a program. They are essential for storing values such as numbers, characters, and more complex data types like arrays or objects. By assigning a name to a variable, developers can easily refer to and modify data throughout their code, enhancing readability and flexibility.
